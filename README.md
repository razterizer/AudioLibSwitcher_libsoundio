This is to become an adapter of the `IAudioLibSwitcher` interface for `libsoundio` which is of MIT license.

An adapter / interface implementation of the `IAudioLibSwitcher` interface (see [AudioLibSwitcher](https://github.com/razterizer/AudioLibSwitcher)) for [libsoundio]([https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft](https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio)).

When cloning, don't forget to use the flag `--recurse-submodules`. For example: `git clone AudioLibSwitcher_libsoundio --recurse-submodules`

## NOTE:

This repo is Work In Progress and is not working at the moment.
I'm trying to flesh out the main code structure of the layer between the interface and `libsoundio` at the moment.
